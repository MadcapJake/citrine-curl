# Citrine Curl mod

A wrapper for libcurl in Citrine that allows simple blocking requests.  Currently only supports the easy interface.

Please submit an issue if you see a potential enhancement or issue that you'd like addressed. Pull requests are also welcome. If you do submit code, please be sure to include tests.

### Roadmap
- Refine perform or split out string result somehow
- Support Curl's multi interface
- Support more function/data options
- Add more tests
